# Self-Driving Car Project

## Overview
The **Self-Driving Car** project is an advanced system that simulates autonomous vehicle operations. It integrates various technologies to enable the vehicle to navigate, sense its environment, and make decisions without human intervention.

## Features
- **Sensor Integration**: Utilizes a combination of sensors (e.g., LiDAR, cameras, ultrasonic sensors) to gather environmental data.
- **Path Planning**: Implements algorithms for route optimization and obstacle avoidance.
- **Object Detection**: Employs machine learning models to identify vehicles, pedestrians, traffic signals, and road signs.
- **Autonomous Navigation**: Executes real-time decisions for acceleration, braking, and steering based on sensor input.
- **Collision Avoidance**: Ensures safety by detecting potential obstacles and adjusting the vehicle's trajectory.
- **Mapping and Localization**: Uses SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) techniques for dynamic map creation and localization.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: [Specify languages used, e.g., Python, C++, Java]
- **Frameworks and Libraries**: TensorFlow, OpenCV, ROS (Robot Operating System)
- **Hardware**: [Specify hardware components if applicable, e.g., Raspberry Pi, Arduino, Jetson Nano]
- **Algorithms**: A*, Dijkstra, Deep Learning (CNNs), Reinforcement Learning
- **Simulation Tools**: [Specify tools like Gazebo, CARLA, or other simulators]

## Implementation Highlights
- Designed a robust **control system** for managing speed and direction.
- Developed a **real-time object detection model** to enhance situational awareness.
- Integrated a **decision-making system** based on sensor data and road conditions.
- Validated the project using [state simulators/real-world testing environments].
